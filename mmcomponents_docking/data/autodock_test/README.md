This data set serves as a test case for autodock vina:

- structs/ligand.pdb: imatinib drug molecule
- structs/ligand_exp.pdb: experimentally determined pose of imatinib
- structs/receptor.pdb: crystal structure of 1IEP

Invoking ./run.sh runs two docking simulations: rigid receptor - rigid ligand, rigid
